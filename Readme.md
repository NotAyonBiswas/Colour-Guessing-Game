# Colour Guessing Game

This is a game where the computer takes a randomised guess from the colour palette forming a rainbow. The program let's the user guess only four times, thus making it a little harder and interesting. 

## Construct

The program is function defined with an error checking block, the actual game block and the main menue block.

In future, gui would be added to the program and possible might be hosted on a website.
